#Background
As more and more species face extinction everyday, the importance of tracking wildlife and documenting the number of each species in various wild environments grows as well. At the same time, the need to let them live uncaptivated remains and so does the difficulties of keeping track of their population as they run free. Human trackers may have done a good job so far, however it takes a signficantly long time to explore an entire wild area. Furthermore, the animals are also always on the move, so the possibility of missing many of them is considerably high.

With the advancement of technology in this modern era, we know that there exists means to sweep areas with drones. This can be seen in several countries, such as China, that uses drones to help police officers look for criminals and obtain their whereabouts. This is because drones can work simultaneously while communicating with each other, thus improving the overall search time significantly.

If we apply the same strategy in the wildlife areas, we will be able to generate comprehensive data of the animals in their natural habitat. By doing this, larger areas can be covered in considerably shorter timespans. In order to make use of these drones effectively, we need a method for the drone to identify and directly classify the animals, instead of humans having to manually keep track of all the animals found.

#Introduction
We are using Tensorflow, open source software library from google in order to be able to classify type of animals from a given image

we are using 3 type of dogs as a prototype to be able to see if we can recognize different type of animals from an image or video


#2. Pre-Requisites
If you do not have Python on your machine, download Python version 3.6.4. Otherwise, make sure the version you are using is compatible with the TensorFlow library. To check your current version of python installed:
```$ python --version```
Once, you have the correct version, install TensorFlow. You can clone the repository or download zip from (here)[https://github.com/tensorflow/models] and follow the instructions from (here)[https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md].
